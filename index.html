    <h2>A Short Bio</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Miguel Nazario. I was born and raised in Queens and still live here today. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Philosophy, which I am proud of considering the amount of reading I had to do. Diversity and inclusion is something that is very important to me as it directly relates to my experience but also the experiences of people I care about. One of my aspirations in learning how to code is to use my skills to work at organizations that support communities, whether it be through education, housing, or finances. One of my favorite lines from a book that inspires me to continue moving forward is <q>Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold</q> (<em>The Outsiders</em> by S.E. Hinton).
        </p>
    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>My favorite color is brown. My favorite sport is volleyball, but I grew up playing a number of sports. Some of the shows I watched recently include: Survivor, RuPaul's Drag Race, Selling Sunset, 20Somethings. (#NetflixSponsorMe). I love to travel! Two cities on my bucket list are Paris and Seoul.
